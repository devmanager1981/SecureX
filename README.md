## 📖 **Project Overview**

This system provides intelligent home security monitoring by combining IoT sensor data with AI-powered threat analysis and real-time 3D visualization. Unlike traditional rule-based security systems, this platform incorporates **time-contextual weighting** to distinguish between normal activity patterns and genuine security threats.

The system monitors sensor devices (motion detectors, vibration sensors, door locks), analyzes event sequences using temporal pattern detection, controls actuator devices (smart bulbs, sirens, locks) in response to threats, and provides a digital twin visualization of home security status using Three.js.

### Key Innovations

- **Time-Contextual AI**: Threat scores are adjusted based on time of day—motion at 3 AM is weighted more heavily than motion at 3 PM
- **Pattern Detection**: Analyzes sequences of events (e.g., motion followed by window vibration) to detect break-in attempts
- **Graduated Response**: Three-tier classification system prevents false alarms while ensuring critical threats receive immediate response
- **Real-Time Digital Twin**: 3D visualization provides instant visual feedback of security status across home zones

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: AI-powered analysis with time-contextual weighting (1.5x multiplier at night, 0.7x during day)
- **Smart Device Integration**: Connects to Tuya smart bulbs, sirens, locks, motion sensors, and vibration sensors via WebSocket
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive digital twin showing security status across three home zones (Foyer, Living Room, Master Bedroom)
- **Graduated Response**: Three-tier threat classification (RED_CRITICAL, YELLOW_WARNING, GREEN_SAFE) with appropriate actions
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional updates between backend and frontend
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects motion + vibration sequences within 10-second windows
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Exponential backoff reconnection for both Tuya Cloud and frontend connections

#### 2. Configure Tuya Credentials

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp backend/config.example.py backend/config.py

# Edit backend/config.py with your credentials
```

**Required configuration values:**
```python
CLIENT_ID = "nw7hjqy8kdred7p5tn9j"
SECRET_KEY = "5d5e833bc97c493c99ab46db36418a35"

DEVICES = {
    'LIVING_ROOM_MOTION_ID': 'vdevo176449224066131',
    'WINDOW_VIBRATION_ID': 'vdevo176449226291392',
    'FRONT_DOOR_LOCK_ID': 'vdevo176449220885548',
    'SMART_BULB_ID': 'vdevo176449218406418',
    'SIREN_ID': 'vdevo176449228685894'
}
```

See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for detailed instructions on obtaining these values.

#### 3. Run the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
python ai_agent.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Loading configuration...
[INFO] Configuration loaded successfully
[INFO] Connecting to Tuya Cloud...
[INFO] Connected to Tuya Cloud
[INFO] Subscribing to devices...
[INFO] Subscribed to 5 devices
[INFO] Starting Flask WebSocket server on port 5000...
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` and begin monitoring your Tuya devices.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is a single HTML file with embedded JavaScript—no build process required!

#### Option 1: Direct File Open (Simplest)

Simply open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser by double-clicking the file or using File > Open.

**Note:** Some browsers restrict WebSocket connections from `file://` URLs. If you encounter connection issues, use Option 2.

#### Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Using Python's built-in HTTP server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000

# Navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Alternative servers:**
```bash
# Using Node.js http-server (if installed)
npx http-server frontend -p 8000

# Using PHP (if installed)
cd frontend
php -S localhost:8000
```

#### 3. Verify Connection

Once the frontend loads, you should see:
- A 3D top-down view of three zones (Foyer, Living Room, Master Bedroom)
- A connection status indicator showing "Connected" (green)
- Zones displayed in light gray wireframe (default state)

If the connection status shows "Disconnected" (red), verify the backend server is running on port 5000.

### Configuration

#### Obtaining Tuya API Credentials

Follow these steps to get your Tuya Cloud API credentials:

1. **Create a Tuya IoT Platform Account**
   - Visit [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account or log in

2. **Create a Cloud Project**
   - Navigate to "Cloud" > "Development"
   - Click "Create Cloud Project"
   - Select "Smart Home" as the industry
   - Select your data center region (choose closest to your location)
   - Name your project (e.g., "Security Digital Twin")

3. **Get API Credentials**
   - After creating the project, you'll see the project overview
   - Copy the **Access ID/Client ID** (looks like: `vx7a8xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - Copy the **Access Secret/Secret Key** (looks like: `3f9xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxe4a`)
   - Save these securely—you'll need them for `config.py`

4. **Link Your Devices**
   - Go to "Devices" > "Link Tuya App Account"
   - Scan the QR code with your Tuya Smart or Smart Life mobile app
   - This links all devices from your app to the cloud project
   - Wait a few minutes for devices to sync

5. **Find Device IDs**
   - Go to "Devices" > "All Devices"
   - You'll see a list of all your linked devices
   - Click on each device to view its details
   - Copy the **Device ID** (looks like: `bfxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - Match each device to its role in the system

#### Required Device IDs

Configure the following device IDs in `backend/config.py`:

| Configuration Key | Device Type | Purpose | Example Device |
|------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `LIVING_ROOM_MOTION_ID` | Motion Sensor | Detects movement in living room | PIR motion detector |
| `WINDOW_VIBRATION_ID` | Vibration Sensor | Detects window/door vibration | Contact sensor with vibration detection |
| `FRONT_DOOR_LOCK_ID` | Smart Lock | Monitors lock/unlock events | Tuya smart deadbolt |
| `SMART_BULB_ID` | Smart Bulb | Visual alerts (colors, flashing) | RGB smart bulb |
| `SIREN_ID` | Smart Siren | Audio alerts for critical threats | Smart alarm siren |

**Note:** If you don't have all five device types, you can use the same device ID for multiple roles during testing (e.g., use a smart plug ID for the siren). However, for full functionality, all five device types are recommended.

## Threat Scenarios

The system implements three distinct threat levels with graduated responses. Each scenario demonstrates how time-contextual AI and pattern detection work together to provide intelligent security monitoring.

### 🔴 RED_CRITICAL: Break-in Attempt

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Motion detected in living room (LIVING_ROOM_MOTION_ID)
- **AND** window vibration detected (WINDOW_VIBRATION_ID) within 10 seconds
- Time-contextual weighting applied (1.5x multiplier at night increases threat score)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Time: 2:47 AM (nighttime)
Event 1: Motion detected in living room
Event 2: Window vibration detected (8 seconds later)

Threat Calculation:
- Base score: 90 (motion + vibration pattern)
- Time weight: 1.5x (nighttime multiplier)
- Final score: 135
- Classification: RED_CRITICAL (score >= 80)
```

**Automated Response:**
1. **Smart Bulb**: Activate red strobe mode (flashing at 2Hz)
2. **Siren**: Activate audio alarm
3. **Front Door Lock**: Engage lock for security
4. **Push Notification**: Send critical alert to user's device
5. **Digital Twin**: Flash all three zones red in 3D visualization

**Visual Feedback:**
- All zones (Foyer, Living Room, Master Bedroom) flash red
- Connection status shows "CRITICAL ALERT"
- Flashing continues until threat is cleared

---

### 🟡 YELLOW_WARNING: Suspicious Activity

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Motion detected in living room (LIVING_ROOM_MOTION_ID)
- **NO** follow-up vibration event within 10 seconds
- Could be a pet, family member, or false alarm

**Example Scenario:**
```
Time: 11:23 PM (nighttime)
Event 1: Motion detected in living room
Event 2: (no follow-up within 10 seconds)

Threat Calculation:
- Base score: 50 (motion alone, no vibration)
- Time weight: 1.5x (nighttime multiplier)
- Final score: 75
- Classification: YELLOW_WARNING (40 <= score < 80)
```

**Automated Response:**
1. **Smart Bulb**: Soft pulsing yellow at low brightness (non-alarming)
2. **Digital Twin**: Highlight Living Room zone in yellow
3. **No Siren**: Graduated response avoids false alarms
4. **No Lock**: Door remains in current state

**Visual Feedback:**
- Only the Living Room zone turns yellow
- Other zones remain in default state
- Provides awareness without panic

**Daytime Example:**
```
Time: 2:15 PM (daytime)
Event 1: Motion detected in living room
Event 2: (no follow-up within 10 seconds)

Threat Calculation:
- Base score: 50 (motion alone)
- Time weight: 0.7x (daytime multiplier)
- Final score: 35
- Classification: GREEN_SAFE (score < 40)

Result: No action taken—normal daytime activity
```

---

### 🟢 GREEN_SAFE: Safe Arrival

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Front door unlocked (FRONT_DOOR_LOCK_ID status change to unlocked)
- Indicates authorized entry by homeowner

**Example Scenario:**
```
Time: 6:45 PM (evening)
Event: Front door unlocked

Threat Calculation:
- Base score: 0 (unlock event is safe)
- Classification: GREEN_SAFE
```

**Automated Response:**
1. **Smart Bulb**: Set to warm white at 20% brightness (welcoming ambiance)
2. **Clear Warnings**: Reset all active warning states
3. **Digital Twin**: Change all zones to calm blue-white color

**Visual Feedback:**
- All zones display subtle blue-white color
- Creates welcoming atmosphere
- Confirms system recognizes authorized entry

---

### Time-Contextual Intelligence

The system's AI adjusts threat perception based on time of day:

| Time Period | Hours | Multiplier | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Nighttime** | 10:00 PM - 6:00 AM | 1.5x | Motion at night is more suspicious |
| **Daytime** | 6:00 AM - 10:00 PM | 0.7x | Motion during day is normal activity |

**Example Impact:**
- Same motion event at 3:00 AM → Higher threat score → More likely to trigger alert
- Same motion event at 3:00 PM → Lower threat score → Less likely to trigger alert

This prevents false alarms during normal daytime activity while maintaining high sensitivity at night.

## Testing

The project uses a dual testing approach combining unit tests and property-based tests for comprehensive coverage.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Run all tests (excluding integration tests)
pytest backend/ -v

# Run all tests including integration tests
pytest backend/ -v -m ""

# Run only integration tests (requires TUYA_RUN_INTEGRATION='true')
pytest backend/ -v -m integration

# Exclude integration tests explicitly
pytest backend/ -v -m "not integration"

# Run property-based tests only
pytest backend/ -v -k "property"

# Run unit tests only
pytest backend/ -v -k "not property"

# Run with coverage report
pytest backend/ --cov=backend --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest backend/test_threat_analyzer.py -v
```

### Integration Tests

The project includes integration tests that verify behavior against the real Tuya Cloud API. These tests are **skipped by default** to prevent accidental API calls with placeholder credentials.

**To run integration tests:**

```bash
# Set environment variable to enable integration tests
export TUYA_RUN_INTEGRATION='true'  # macOS/Linux
set TUYA_RUN_INTEGRATION=true       # Windows CMD
$env:TUYA_RUN_INTEGRATION='true'    # Windows PowerShell

# Run integration tests
pytest backend/test_tuya_integration.py -v
```

**Integration test scenarios:**
1. **Authentication Failure Test**: Verifies system handles invalid credentials correctly
2. **Device Reachability Test**: Confirms proper error handling for non-existent devices
3. **Command Failure Test**: Validates error responses when sending commands to unreachable actuators

**Note:** Integration tests use placeholder credentials and are designed to fail gracefully. They verify error handling behavior rather than successful operations. To test with real devices, update the placeholder credentials in the test file.

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

**Property-Based Tests (26 properties):**
- Configuration loading and validation
- Event sequence management
- Time-contextual threat scoring
- Pattern detection algorithms
- Response protocol execution
- WebSocket message handling
- Frontend visualization updates

**Unit Tests:**
- Specific threat scenarios (motion at 3 AM, door unlock at 6 PM)
- Edge cases (empty sequences, exact 10-second timing)
- Integration tests (end-to-end event flow)
- Error handling (connection failures, invalid commands)

### Test Results

All tests should pass before deployment:
```
======================== test session starts =========================
collected 45 items

backend/test_config.py::test_property_config_loading PASSED    [  2%]
backend/test_config.py::test_property_missing_config PASSED    [  4%]
backend/test_threat_analyzer.py::test_property_event_append PASSED [  6%]
...
======================== 45 passed in 12.34s =========================
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

#### Connection to Tuya Cloud Fails

**Symptoms:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to connect to Tuya Cloud
[ERROR] Authentication failed
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Credentials:**
   - Double-check CLIENT_ID and SECRET_KEY in `backend/config.py`
   - Ensure no extra spaces or quotes in the values
   - Credentials should be strings without the `<>` brackets

2. **Check Device Linking:**
   - Go to Tuya IoT Platform → Devices → Link Tuya App Account
   - Ensure your devices are linked to the cloud project
   - Wait 5-10 minutes after linking for sync to complete

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Ensure your firewall allows WebSocket connections
   - Check if your network blocks connections to Tuya Cloud (some corporate networks do)
   - Try disabling VPN if active

4. **Region Mismatch:**
   - Verify your cloud project region matches your device region
   - Devices registered in Europe won't work with a US cloud project

#### Devices Not Responding to Commands

**Symptoms:**
```
[ERROR] Command transmission failed for device bf...
[ERROR] Device offline or unreachable
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Device IDs:**
   - Check device IDs in `backend/config.py` match Tuya IoT Platform
   - Device IDs are case-sensitive and should be exact matches

2. **Check Device Status:**
   - Open Tuya Smart or Smart Life app
   - Verify devices show as "Online"
   - Try controlling devices manually in the app

3. **Review Logs:**
   - Check backend console for detailed error messages
   - Look for retry attempts (system retries up to 3 times)
   - Common errors:
     - `Device offline`: Device lost WiFi connection
     - `Invalid command`: Command format doesn't match device capabilities
     - `Permission denied`: Device not linked to cloud project

4. **Device Capabilities:**
   - Not all devices support all commands
   - Verify your smart bulb supports color commands
   - Some locks only support lock/unlock, not status reporting

#### Backend Server Won't Start

**Symptoms:**
```
[ERROR] Configuration validation failed
[ERROR] Missing required field: CLIENT_ID
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Configuration Missing:**
   - Ensure `backend/config.py` exists (not just `config.example.py`)
   - Verify all required fields are present
   - Check for typos in variable names

2. **Port Already in Use:**
   ```
   [ERROR] Address already in use: Port 5000
   ```
   - Another process is using port 5000
   - Find and stop the process:
     ```bash
     # Windows
     netstat -ano | findstr :5000
     taskkill /PID <PID> /F
     
     # macOS/Linux
     lsof -i :5000
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - Or change the port in `websocket_server.py`

3. **Missing Dependencies:**
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tuya_connector'
   ```
   - Activate virtual environment
   - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Event Sequence Not Detecting Patterns

**Symptoms:**
- Motion + vibration events occur but no RED_CRITICAL alert

**Solutions:**
1. **Timing Window:**
   - Vibration must occur within 10 seconds of motion
   - Check event timestamps in logs
   - Events more than 10 seconds apart won't trigger pattern

2. **Device ID Mismatch:**
   - Verify LIVING_ROOM_MOTION_ID and WINDOW_VIBRATION_ID are correct
   - Check logs to see which device IDs are sending events

3. **Time-Contextual Scoring:**
   - During daytime, scores are reduced by 0.7x multiplier
   - Motion + vibration at 2 PM might not reach RED_CRITICAL threshold
   - Test at night (after 10 PM) for higher scores

### Frontend Issues

#### 3D Visualization Not Loading

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Performance

- **Event Processing**: Events are processed in real-time with minimal latency (<100ms)
- **WebSocket Connections**: Supports multiple concurrent frontend clients
- **Memory Usage**: Event buffer limited to 3 events (minimal memory footprint)
- **CPU Usage**: Lightweight threat analysis algorithms (<5% CPU on modern hardware)

### Frontend Performance

- **3D Rendering**: 60 FPS on modern hardware with WebGL
- **Animation**: Smooth color transitions using requestAnimationFrame
- **Memory**: Minimal memory usage (~50MB for Three.js scene)
- **Network**: Low bandwidth usage (JSON messages <1KB each)

### Scalability

Current implementation is designed for single-home deployment. For multi-home deployments:

- Add database for event persistence
- Implement user authentication
- Add home/user isolation
- Scale WebSocket server horizontally

## Security Considerations

### API Credentials

- **Never commit** `config.py` to version control
- Store credentials in environment variables for production
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude `config.py`
- Rotate credentials periodically

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS/WSS for production deployments
- Implement authentication for WebSocket connections
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use firewall rules to restrict access

### Device Security

- Keep Tuya devices firmware updated
- Use strong WiFi passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication on Tuya account
- Review device permissions regularly

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Use Environment Variables:**
   ```python
   import os
   CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get('TUYA_CLIENT_ID')
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('TUYA_SECRET_KEY')
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS/WSS:**
   - Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx, Apache)
   - Use SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
   - Update frontend WebSocket URL to `wss://`

3. **Process Management:**
   - Use systemd, supervisor, or PM2 to manage backend process
   - Enable auto-restart on failure
   - Configure logging to files

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Monitor CPU/memory usage
   - Track WebSocket connection count
   - Alert on repeated connection failures

### Docker Deployment (Optional)

Create `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY backend/ ./backend/
CMD ["python", "backend/ai_agent.py"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t tuya-security-twin .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e TUYA_CLIENT_ID=xxx -e TUYA_SECRET_KEY=yyy tuya-security-twin
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with non-Tuya devices?**
A: The current implementation is specific to Tuya devices. To support other platforms (SmartThings, Home Assistant, etc.), you would need to implement a new connection manager with the same interface.

**Q: How accurate is the threat detection?**
A: The system uses pattern detection and time-contextual weighting to reduce false positives. Accuracy depends on proper sensor placement and configuration. The graduated response system (RED/YELLOW/GREEN) helps minimize false alarms.

**Q: Can I customize the threat scoring algorithm?**
A: Yes! Edit `threat_analyzer.py` to adjust base scores, time multipliers, or classification thresholds. Be sure to update the corresponding property tests.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: No, the system requires internet connectivity to communicate with Tuya Cloud. Tuya devices use cloud-based communication rather than local protocols.

**Q: Can I add more zones to the 3D visualization?**
A: Yes! Edit `frontend/index.html` to add more zone meshes. Update the visualization controller to handle the new zones.

**Q: How do I add more device types?**
A: Add new device IDs to `config.py`, update the response protocols in `response_orchestrator.py`, and add corresponding tests.

**Q: What's the latency between sensor trigger and response?**
A: Typical latency is 2-5 seconds:
- Sensor → Tuya Cloud: 1-2 seconds
- Backend processing: <100ms
- Command → Actuator: 1-2 seconds
- Frontend update: <100ms

**Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
A: Check the license terms. The MIT license is permissive, but ensure compliance with Tuya's terms of service for commercial use.
